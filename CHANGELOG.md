# Changelog

English | [简体中文](https://github.com/Liafonx/Balatro-SaveRewinder/blob/main/CHANGELOG_zh.md)

All notable changes to Save Rewinder will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.6.1] - 2026-01-17

### Changed
- **Release package structure** — Changed zip file structure: mod files are now wrapped in a `SaveRewinder` folder instead of being at the root

> ℹ️ **Note**: This version contains **no new features or bug fixes**. It only changes the release zip structure for easier installation. If you had any trouble installing or updating to version 1.4.6, please use this version. Otherwise, **no update is needed** if you're already running 1.4.6 successfully.

> 📦 **Thunderstore Users**: The Thunderstore package structure remains unchanged — files are still at the root directory (not wrapped in a folder).

## [1.4.6] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Smart Continue matching** — When you continue a run, the mod automatically highlights your exact position in the save list (even if it's not the latest save)
- **Custom save identifier** — Saves now include a unique `_rewinder_id` field for exact matching

### Fixed
- **First opening pack save blocked** — Opening pack saves now work correctly after restoring to "entering shop"
- **Shop save after pack labeled as reroll** — Shop saves after closing a pack now labeled as "In shop" instead of "Reroll shop"
- **Choose blind ordinal reset** — Sequential choose blind saves now increment correctly (B1, B2, B3)
- **Duplicate saves after restore** — Fixed duplicate detection state not resetting on restore
- **Page number display not updating** — Page number now correctly updates when clicking "Current save" button
- **Inconsistent window height** — Save list window now maintains consistent height regardless of number of saves displayed

### Improved
- Faster save list loading and highlighting
- Better detection of duplicate saves

> ⚠️ **Note**: This version adds a `_rewinder_id` field to your save data. This does not affect normal gameplay but means **your save.jkr file will be slightly different with this mod installed**.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-01-09

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
